##Testing

Write a new file called test_citibike_predictions.Rmd that loads in the 2015 `trips_2015.Rdata` file and weather data along with your saved model (from yesterday's .Rdata file, and predicts the number of trips for each day.

Compute the RMSE between the actual and predicted trips for 2015 and compare the results to what you found with cross-validation on the 2014 data.

```{r testing}
load('trips_2015.RData')
load('model.RData')

trips_with_weather <- inner_join(trips, weather, by="ymd")

trips_with_weather <- trips_with_weather %>% mutate(tmin = tmin/10, tmax = tmax/10)

set.seed(42)
num_folds <- 10
num_days <- nrow(trips_with_weather)
frac_train <- 0.9
num_train <- floor(num_days * frac_train)

ndx <- sample(1:num_days, num_train, replace=F)

train_data <- train_data[ndx, ] %>%
  mutate(fold = (row_number() %% num_folds) + 1)

trips_per_day_train <- trips_per_day_train %>%
  add_predictions(model) %>%
  mutate(split = "train")
trips_per_day_validate <- trips_per_day_validate %>%
  add_predictions(model) %>%
  mutate(split = "validate")
plot_data <- bind_rows(trips_per_day_train, trips_per_day_validate)

summary(model)
rmse(model, plot_data)

```
